Fine-Tuning YOLOv8 on Basketball Data\n- Collect/annotate basketball-specific training data:\n  * Youth basketball videos with player annotations\n  * Variety of angles, lighting conditions, court surfaces\n  * 500-1000 annotated frames minimum\n- Fine-tune YOLOv8-nano on basketball dataset:\n  * Focus on players in basketball uniforms\n  * Learn to distinguish players from referees, coaches, audience\n  * Improve detection at various distances and angles\n- Use transfer learning: freeze backbone, train detection head\n- Validate on held-out test set\n\n### 2. Temporal Smoothing for Tracking\n- Implement Kalman filter for motion prediction\n- Smooth bounding box jitter across frames\n- Fill short gaps when player temporarily occluded\n- Use velocity estimation to predict next position\n- Helps ByteTrack maintain tracks through occlusions\n\n### 3. Post-Processing Filters\n- Size filtering: Remove detections too small/large for players\n- Aspect ratio filtering: Players typically 1:2 - 1:3 height:width\n- Motion filtering: Eliminate static detections (likely not players)\n- Confidence smoothing: Average confidence across tracking history\n- Non-maximum suppression tuning: Reduce duplicate detections\n\n### 4.
