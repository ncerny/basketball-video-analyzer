Verify CUDA/MPS support in current environment\n2. Enable GPU for YOLO inference (already supported via device parameter)\n3. Move ByteTrack to GPU if beneficial (requires profiling)\n4. Keep court detection on CPU (OpenCV operations not GPU-intensive)\n\n### Phase 2: Apple Neural Engine (ANE)\n1. Convert YOLOv8 model to CoreML format for ANE support\n2. Use coremltools to compile model with ANE optimization\n3. Fall back to GPU/CPU if ANE unavailable\n4. Benchmark ANE vs MPS vs CPU performance\n\n### Phase 3: Batch Optimization\n1. Increase batch_size when GPU available (more VRAM = larger batches)\n2. Experiment with batch sizes: 8 (CPU), 16 (MPS), 32 (CUDA)\n3. Profile memory usage vs speed tradeoffs\n4. Add auto-tuning based on available VRAM\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Files to Modify\n- backend/app/ml/yolo_detector.py - Add CoreML support, batch size tuning\n- backend/app/services/detection_pipeline.py - Adjust batch_size based on device\n- backend/app/config.py - Add GPU-specific config (batch_size_gpu, use_ane)\n- backend/requirements.txt - Add coremltools for ANE support\n\n### Configuration\n```python\n# config.py additions\nyolo_batch_size_cpu: int = 8\nyolo_batch_size_gpu: int = 32\nenable_apple_neural_engine: bool = True\n```\n\n### Benchmarking\n- Add performance logging: frames/second, inference time per batch\n- Create benchmark script to compare CPU/MPS/CUDA/ANE\n- Document optimal settings for each platform","acceptance_criteria":"## Automated Tests\n- Unit test: Device detection correctly identifies available hardware\n- Unit test: Batch size adjusts based on device type\n- Unit test: CoreML model produces same results as PyTorch model (within tolerance)\n- Integration test: GPU pipeline produces correct detections\n\n## Manual Testing\n- Run detection on same video with CPU, MPS, and CUDA (if available)\n- Verify GPU utilization increases during inference (nvidia-smi or Activity Monitor)\n- Measure and compare processing speed: frames/second for each device\n- Confirm ANE model works on Apple Silicon (if available)\n- Verify no accuracy regression with GPU vs CPU\n\n## Performance Goals\n- 2-3x speedup on MPS (Apple Silicon) vs CPU\n- 4-6x speedup on CUDA (NVIDIA) vs CPU\n- ANE comparable or better than MPS (if supported)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-19T08:04:12.030417-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T08:23:00.160986-06:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T08:23:00.160986-06:00"}
